 # Here runs the TEAMSPEAK SERVER

 # ==========================================
 # BASIC USAGE

 # There is an user named 'user', dedicated for running the TS SERVER.
 # 'su' to him before starting the server
 su user

 # The server is located in the 'user' user's home folder
 cd /home/user/teamspeak3-server_linux_amd64

 # The server is then started by './ts3server_startscript.sh' script, followed by an argument 'start', 'stop', 'status' or 'restart'
 ./ts3server_startscript.sh start

 # ==========================================
 # FIRST START OF THE SERVER

 # Before the server is started for the first time, you MUST accept the TS licence.
 # Do it by creating an empty file named '.ts3server_license_accepted' in the server directory
 touch .ts3server_license_accepted

 # Once the serve is started for the FIRST TIME, it will generate set of administartion keys.
 # ** SAVE THOSE KEYS **
 # Otherwise you won't be able to configure the server at all !
 # best place to save those keys is a file named 'TS3_SERVER_SECRETS' in the 'user' user's home folder '/home/user'
 nano /home/user/TS3_SERVER_SECRETS
 # now paste it inside (in terminal CTRL+SHIFT+C, CTRL+SHIFT+V),
 # save and exit with:
 #   CTRL+o
 #   Enter
 #   CTRL+x

 # ==========================================
 # SERVER INSTALLATION

 # In the case you would need to install the server (e.g. a new version of it), here is the overwiew of the steps:
 # (of course, you need to updae the download URL)
 su user
 wget https://files.teamspeak-services.com/releases/server/3.11.0/teamspeak3-server_linux_amd64-3.11.0.tar.bz2
 tar -xof teamspeak3-server_linux_amd64-3.11.0.tar.bz2
 cd teamspeak3-server_linux_amd64
 touch .ts3server_license_accepted
 ./ts3server_startscript.sh start

 # ==========================================
 # SETTINGS:

 # The server settings are saved in the 'ts3server.sqlitedb' file

 # ==========================================
 # NOTES:

 # The server license is vaild for exactly *1 YEAR* only.
 # If the server is older (it's first run was more than 1 year ago) it won't start any more.
 # You then need to install a new server again.
